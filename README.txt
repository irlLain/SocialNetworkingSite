Thankyou for downloading my social networking site!
This was my first Full-Stack Software Engineering project I created during my second year at university!
I chose to show this project because it has a large array of coding, such as JS, HTML, tailwind, vue, and 3rd party libraries. Even though it is 2 years old and I'm positive I could make a more intricate social media site now I still think it's a great foundation to display my web skills, as well as earning me a 1st class in this module.
I hope you enjoy it!

To run the site please navigate to inside the backend server folder and run:
npm install
npm run dev

Now leave this terminal open, open a new cmd from inside the front-end vue-project folder and run:
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview

Now click the link from the cmd line, it should be something like: "http://localhost:4174/".
This will open the project in your browser of choice.

You are now running the social media site!
