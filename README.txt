Thankyou for downloading my social networking site!
To run the site please navigate to inside the backend server folder and run:
npm install
npm run dev

Now leave this terminal open, open a new cmd from inside the front-end vue-project folder and run:
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview

Now click the link from the cmd line, it should be something like: "http://localhost:4174/".
This will open the project in your browser of choice.

You are now running the social media site!
